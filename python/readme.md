This repository showcases a variety of Python scripts created during my journey through the CS50 course and beyond. The scripts are organized into the following categories:

## Project Categories:
* **API Interaction (`api`)**: Scripts that demonstrate how to interact with web APIs, retrieve data, and perform actions programmatically.
* **CS50 Problem Sets (`cs50`)**: Solutions to problem sets from the CS50 course, covering fundamental Python concepts and algorithms.
* **Flask Web Development (`full-flask-blog`)**: A simple Flask web application that uses Python to demonstrate basic web development principles.
* **Automation (`python_for_devops_daily_tasks`)**: Scripts designed to automate repetitive tasks, system administration, or data processing.
* **Web Scraping (`web_scraping/beautiful`)**: Scripts that extract data from websites using the Beautiful Soup library.
